# slappy-fish
a flappy bird clone


This game is based on the short-lived but *highly* addidictive game released for iOS in 2012 called "Flappy Bird". The game existed on the app store for only a few weeks but instantly became a cult classic. You can read more about [Flappy bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird) here.

I built a web based clone of the game using the phaser framework for HTML5 games. It is my Q1 project for Galvanize web development immersive program.
